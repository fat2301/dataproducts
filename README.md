# dataproducts
Data Products final project

Shiny link is at: https://fat2301.shinyapps.io/shiny_project_diamond_price/

For the slidify slides kindly check: http://rpubs.com/fat2301/148436 for the html file. In my tests rpub seems to be viewable, as well as viewing the html locally. I'm having trouble when I try to view the html directly from htmlpreview.github.io though. 

Thanks!
